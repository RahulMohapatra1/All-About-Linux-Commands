- Why to learn Vi?
  - vi is almost always available. POSIX requires vi on Unix systems, making it reliable on remote servers or systems without a GUI, where other editors may not exist.
  - vi is lightweight and fast. It launches instantly, uses minimal resources, and is optimized for fast, keyboard-only editing.
  - We don’t want other Linux and Unix users to think we are cowards.
    Okay, maybe two good reasons.
